    <h3>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
    <h4 class="text-center">
      "His contribution to the nation is eternal and invaluable"
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also spelled as Sivaji was born on 19 February 1630. He was born at Shivneri which
        is a hill fort in Junnar in Poona, now known as Pune. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took birth into a family of
        bureaucrats. His father Shahji Bhonsale was a great Maratha general in the army of Bijapur Sultanate and his
        mother Jijabai was a great devotee of religion. He was the founder of the great Maratha kingdom of India. He was
        one of the bravest and marvelous rulers in the 17th century.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
      Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji used the difficult terrain
      of Western Ghats to his advantage. He captured and built new Hill Forts in Sahyadri Mountain range which proved
      very difficult for invading forces to capture, particularly Mughal armies. Shivaji perfected and used Guerilla
      Warfare to great success against much larger armies of Mughals and Deccan Sultanates. Shivaji built a formidable
      Navy which kept English Navy in check.

    </p>
    <p>
      Shivaji's exploits and potential of Maratha nation threatened Mughals so much that Mughal Emperor Aurangzib
      started a campaign to conquer Marathas shortly after Shivaji's Death. This campaign, better known as
      Mughal–Maratha Wars, was a trategic defeat for Mughals. Aurangzeb failed to crush Marathas, and this campaign had
      a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury and Army.Shortly after Aurangzeb's death, Marathas marched northwards, and
      soon confined Mughals to city of Delhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He
      revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit
      languages,replacing Persian in court and administration. Praised for his chivalrous treatment of Women by
      his enemies,Shivaji employed people of all castes in his administration and army.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India, especially in the state of Maharashtra, where
      he is
      an important figure in the state's history, and an integral part of identity of Marathi people.
